*** THIS LIST IS FOR OLD DNSCRYPT-PROXY VERSIONS ***
Version 2 of the list is for dnscrypt-proxy <= 2.0.42 users.

If you are running up-to-date software, replace /v2/ with /v3/ in the sources URLs of the dnscrypt-proxy.toml file (relevant lines start with urls = ['https://...'] and are present in the [sources] section).

THIS LIST IS AUTOMATICALLY GENERATED AS A SUBSET OF THE V3 LIST. DO NOT EDIT IT MANUALLY.

If you want to contribute changes to a resolvers list, only edit files from the v3 directory.
